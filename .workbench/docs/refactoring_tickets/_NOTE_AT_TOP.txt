⚠️ READ THIS FIRST ⚠️

Path references in tickets 100-600 use CURRENT (flat) structure.

If you execute 002-[STRUCT]-00 first:
  → See 000-PATH-NOTES.md for path mappings
  → Mentally translate: database/ → api/db/, etc.

Quick map:
  database/ → api/db/
  btree/ → store/btree/
  concurrent/ → process/locks/
  (see 000-PATH-NOTES.md for full list)
